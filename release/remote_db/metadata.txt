about=Manage and open <b>ssh</b> connections to remote database servers. This plugin aims to make it easier to connect to firewall protected databases, without using an external ssh tunnel software. 
    All your connections are listed in the UI, allowing you to easily setup ssh tunnels to an arbitrary number of remote computers, with just a few clicks. Each connection displays the mapping between remote & local ports for convenience.
    Currently, you can setup the following parameters:
        -<b>name</b>: A name for you top identify the connection (must be unique)
        -<b>host</b>: host computer (<b>IP</b> or <b>domain</b> name)
        -<b>ssh_port</b>: port on which the remote ssh server is listening
        -<b>remote_port</b>: port on which the remote database/service is listening
        -<b>local_port</b>: local port to use for forwarding
        -<b>username</b>: remote computer username (must have ssh access)
        -<b>password</b>: remote computer password
    It is recommended to choose a <b>different local</b> port for each connection, in order to be able to open many connections simultaneously. Also, ensure that each connection name is unique.
    You can manage your connections via the UI, or you can use the button <b>Settings Folder</b> to open the plugin folder, where the settings live. There, you will find a <b>connections.json</b>, which you can edit or replace in bulk. This is where your connections are stored.
    <b>Attention:</b> in connections.json, your credentials are stored in <b>PLAIN TEXT</b>. You 've been warned...
    Depends on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sshtunnel/">sshtunnel</a> python package.
